# Multi-Wavelength-Laser-Source

This project was a research project that I conducted in my undergrad. The objective was to design, fabricate, 
and test a multi-wavelength laser source that couples the beams of multiple lasers into a common liquid light guide. The final application for such a device was intended to be
in hyperspectral imaging. Having individually adjustible monochromatic sources, would allow for the imaging of sample under multiple pure wavelengths, where each wavelength can
generate an image of the sample that can constitude a colour channel. Three generations of laser sources were developed. The first generation lacked coupling stability. The 
second prototype had subpar laser drivers, thus destroyed all of the diodes. The third generation was relatively successful. The unit has a user-friendly GUI that allows the
user to effectively adjust the brightness and the on/off state of each diode.
